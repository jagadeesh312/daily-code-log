# Daily Code 🚀

## Day 1 – 2026-01-15
- Started my GitHub daily consistency journey
- Learned what a contribution graph is
- Created my first public repositories 
## Day 2 – 2026-01-16
- Worked on the basic project structure
- Created the base HTML file
- Added the initial page layout
## Day 3 – 2026-01-17
- Completed the full project code smart billing
- Connected HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Verified complete functionality
## Day 4 – 2026-01-18
- Implemented AI support for 5 languages in the Smart Billing system
- Added basic text-based AI responses for user interaction
- Improved communication flow for multilingual users
## Day 5 - 2026-01-19
Reviewed the Smart Billing project structure
Organized code into a normal repository format
Added basic report/comments to explain the code flow
Cleaned files for better readability and maintenance
Prepared the project for future feature updates
## Day 6 - 2026-01-20
Reviewed the existing Smart Billing codebase
Simplified logic and removed unnecessary complexity
Improved folder structure for better readability
Added small comments to make the code easier to understand later
Checked everything runs smoothly without errors
## Day 7 - 2026-01-21
Defined the purpose of the AI (what it should do and who it helps)
Decided the core features for the first version
Chose the tech stack for AI logic (language + tools)
Designed a basic flow:
user input → analysis → response
Began writing initial AI logic / prompts
Planned how this AI will connect with your Smart Billing project
## Day 8 - 2026-01-22
Refined the AI logic flow so questions lead to cleaner, clearer answers.
Simplified parts of the code for readability and reuse.
Reviewed earlier days’ work to remove small bugs and confusion points.
Thought about how your personal AI should think, not just respond.
## Day 9 - 2026-01-23
Continued shaping your personal AI project, focusing on clarity and structure.
Refined logic flow so questions → analysis → answers feel more natural.
Cleaned up earlier code and removed unnecessary parts to keep things light.
Thought about how the AI should think, not just what it should say. That’s a big leap.
## Day 10 - 2026-01-24
Reviewed the existing project structure and cleaned up small inconsistencies
Refined logic and naming to keep the code readable and future-proof
Tested previous features to ensure everything still behaves as expected
Mentally planned the next upgrade path instead of rushing into random code
## Day 11 - 2026-01-25
Cleaned and organized project structure so future features don’t trip over yesterday’s code.
Tested HTML, CSS, and JS flow together, especially how things behave in preview vs after publish.
Refined API usage logic from earlier experiments, fewer guesses, more certainty.
Noted down small bugs and UI quirks instead of ignoring them for “later”.
## Day 12 - 2026-01-26
Used Android Studio to start building a voice-based caller app
Explored how voice input can trigger call actions
Set up the basic project structure (activities, permissions)
## Day 13 - 2026-01-27
Today I continued improving my ongoing projects and focused on learning through hands-on practice.
I reviewed previous code, fixed small issues, and explored ways to improve structure and usability.
Even small progress today helped strengthen my understanding and kept the consistency going.
